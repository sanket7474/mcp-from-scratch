// framing.js - buffer a readable stream and emit one complete line per message
//
// The problem this solves:
//
//   Node.js streams fire 'data' events as bytes arrive. Those chunks have no
//   guaranteed relationship to your JSON messages. One 'data' event might carry
//   half a message; the next might carry two messages and a fragment of a third.
//
//   MCP's stdio transport uses newline-delimited JSON: every message is a single
//   JSON object followed by '\n'. The framer turns the raw byte stream into a
//   series of complete line strings, one per MCP message.
//
// Usage:
//
//   createFramer(process.stdin, (line) => {
//     const msg = decode(line);   // from jsonrpc.js
//     dispatcher.dispatch(msg);
//   });

/**
 * Attach a line framer to a Node.js Readable stream.
 *
 * Calls `onLine(line)` once for each complete `\n`-terminated line.
 * The trailing `\n` is stripped before calling `onLine`.
 * Blank lines (empty or whitespace-only) are silently skipped.
 *
 * @param {import('stream').Readable} readable - Any Node.js readable stream.
 * @param {(line: string) => void}    onLine   - Called with each complete line.
